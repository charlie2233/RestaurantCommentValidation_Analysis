# qsr-audit-pipeline

A Python pipeline for auditing Quick-Service Restaurant (QSR) operational workbooks,
enforcing data quality through a Bronze → Silver → Gold medallion architecture.

---

## Purpose

QSR operators routinely export operational data (sales, labour, waste, variance) into
Excel workbooks. These workbooks are *hypothesis artifacts*: they represent someone's
best guess at what happened, assembled from multiple sources with manual intervention.
This pipeline treats every raw workbook as an **untrusted hypothesis artifact**, not a
source of truth, and systematically
validates, normalises, and reconciles it before any analysis is performed.

## Why the workbook is treated as a hypothesis artifact

| Concern | Detail |
|---|---|
| Manual assembly | Cells may be hand-typed, formulae broken, or rows hidden |
| Schema drift | Column names and positions change between export versions |
| Partial data | Missing periods, filtered rows, or cut-off dates |
| Conflation | Multiple data sources merged without provenance tracking |

By treating the workbook as a *claim to be verified* rather than a *truth to be read*,
the pipeline surfaces discrepancies explicitly and halts promotion of bad data.

## Bronze / Silver / Gold flow

```
data/raw/          ← original workbooks, untouched
    │
    ▼  qsr-audit ingest-workbook --input <source>
data/bronze/       ← raw data parsed into Parquet, schema-tagged, provenance recorded
    │
    ▼  qsr-audit validate --layer bronze
data/silver/       ← cleaned, normalised, de-duplicated, type-cast
    │
    ▼  qsr-audit validate --layer silver
data/gold/         ← reconciled, aggregated, ready for reporting
    │
    ▼  qsr-audit report --output reports/
reports/           ← HTML / PDF / Excel audit reports
```

Only Gold-layer outputs are safe for downstream reporting and strategy. Bronze and
Silver are working layers for parsing, normalising, validating, and reconciling the
workbook's claims.

---

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Install (editable + dev deps)
make setup

# 2. Ingest a workbook
qsr-audit ingest-workbook --input data/raw/source_workbook.xlsx

# 3. Validate the Silver layer
qsr-audit validate --layer silver

# 4. Generate reports
qsr-audit report --output reports/
```

Or use the Makefile shortcuts:

```bash
make run-ingest
make run-validate
make run-report
```

## Next implementation steps

1. `ingest` -> load the workbook into Bronze with provenance and source metadata.
2. `normalize` -> standardise column names, types, and business definitions into Silver.
3. `validate` -> enforce layer-specific schemas and data quality checks.
4. `reconcile` -> compare claims across sources and promote trusted outputs into Gold.
5. `report` -> generate audit and strategy/reporting outputs from Gold only.

## Configuration

Settings are read from environment variables (prefix `QSR_`) or a `.env` file:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `QSR_DATA_RAW` | `data/raw` | Raw input directory |
| `QSR_DATA_BRONZE` | `data/bronze` | Bronze layer directory |
| `QSR_DATA_SILVER` | `data/silver` | Silver layer directory |
| `QSR_DATA_GOLD` | `data/gold` | Gold layer directory |
| `QSR_REPORTS_DIR` | `reports` | Report output directory |
| `QSR_LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Logging verbosity |

---

## Development

```bash
# Lint
make lint

# Tests
make test

# Lint + tests in one shot (CI parity)
ruff check src tests && pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing
```
